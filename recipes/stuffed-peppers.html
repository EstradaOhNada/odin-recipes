    </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1lb ground beef</li>
            <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>
            <li>16oz tomato sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tsp italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>bring water and rice to a boil in covered saucepan.
                <br>Reduce head to low and simmer until rice is tender</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat.
                <br> Add ground beef and cook until evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight.</li>
            <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
            <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
